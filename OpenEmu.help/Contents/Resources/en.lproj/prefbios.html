<h1>Preferences: System Files</h1>

<p>In order to emulate some systems, BIOS files are needed due to increasing complexity of the hardware and software of modern gaming consoles. If the core you are currently trying to use needs a BIOS file, OpenEmu will alert you with a popup message. Before installing a BIOS, make sure that its filename and md5 hash are correct, or it will not work! Installing a BIOS is as simple as adding a game to OpenEmu, just drag-and-drop a BIOS onto your library!</p>
